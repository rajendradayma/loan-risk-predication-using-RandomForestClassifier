# loan-risk-predication-using-RandomForestClassifier
The project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan risk (Risk_Flag: 1=high risk, 0=low risk). Steps include data exploration, feature engineering, model building (RandomForestClassifier), evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC), and reporting insights, feature importance, and performance metrics in a PDF.
